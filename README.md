# Developer Setup Guide

This is a guide to installing all the development tools you need to develop
fullstack applications on macOS, Windows or Ubuntu Linux. *(The Ubuntu instructions will probably work for other Debian based Linux distros as well)*

There are three guides depending on operating system:

## [Windows](windows/setup.md)
## [macOS](macos/setup.md)
## [Ubuntu](ubuntu/setup.md)
